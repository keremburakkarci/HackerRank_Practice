//Declare 4 variables: two of type int and two of type float.
//Read 2 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your 4 variables.
//Use the + and - operator to perform the following operations:
//Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.
//Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.
